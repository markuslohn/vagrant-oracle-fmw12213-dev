  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.

  # using a specific IP.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|

    vb.name = "Oracle Middleware Development 12.2.1.3"
    vb.memory = "6144"

  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.
